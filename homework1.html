            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow"> 1. Find the XHTML 1.0 Specifications by W3C and write a short paragraph describing Section 4.6</h1> </a> <font size="6">

				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> Section 4.6 of the XHTML 1.0 specifications details the "Empty Elements" guidelines for XHTML. It states that empty elements must have an end tag or the start tag must end with "/>". It also offers two examples. 
																		The first being the tag &lt;br/&gt;, which signifies a line break. The other being &lt;hr/&gt;, which defines a thematic change in the content. If you do not use a backslash to terminate the empty element, it could possibly return an error. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
			
            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow"> 2. Select and describe (short paragraph) something of interest regarding the history/development of HTML other than HTML 5.
</h1> </a> <font size="6">
  
  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> Html was developed by the physicist Tim Berners-Lee when he proposed an Internet-based hypertext system. I find it interesting that the first publically available description of HTML was just a document titled “HTML Tags”. It described only 18 elements that comprised the initial, simplistic design of HTML. 11 of these elements are still used in HTML 4. From these 18 tags, the entire Hypertext Markup Language was created. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

  
  
       	   <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow"> 3. Describe the evolution from HTML 4 to HTML 5. List at least three new tags or concepts that HTML 5 has to offer web developers.
</h1> </a> <font size="6">

  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> The primary goal of the upgrade from html 4 to html 5 is consistent, defined error handling. A secondary goal of the new HTML is to develop the ability of the browser to be an application platform via languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This can be done using a few new elements that were introduced. The new &lt;canvas&gt; element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting. The new &lt;source&gt; tag is a media element that can define multiple resources for the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags. Finally, the new &lt;embed&gt; tag defines a container for an external application or interactive content (plug-in). All of these new features make the upgrade to HTML 5 worthwhile in the modern information technology age. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
