            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow"> Choose a purpose and target audience for a website. For example, a website selling  hair products for women. Select an image that could be used in the header section of the website. Choose three other images to support your website. 
</h1> </a> <font size="6">

<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow">Post each image and specify the following:
 </h1> </a> <font size="6">
 <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow">1. Why you chose it?
 </h1> </a> <font size="6"><font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow">2. What image manipulation did you have to do?
 </h1> </a> <font size="6"><font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow">3. Where did you get the image?

							<font size="2"> <h1 style="color : White"> I chose to gather images based on a hypothetical catering company that is targeted at large corporations or organizations. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 1.	I chose this as my header image because of a lot of factors. First, it has a large quantity of dishes. This demonstrates that the catering company can deal with an inordinate amount of guests. Second, everything looks delicious. The portions are big, the water gives a feeling of refreshment, and everything is garnished professionally. Third, the image is just eye-catching. It is colorful, you can see the frost on the glasses, and the background is out of focus making you feel like the table goes on forever. It makes you want to be important enough to attend an event of this caliber.</h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 2.	The image was slightly too large originally. This is about a 25% reduction in size to act as a functional header. It is bright and colorful, requiring no touch-ups.</h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 3.	I obtained this picture from another catering company at sevenstarcatering.com. They use it to display the ultimate package they offer. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 1.	I chose this image as the only one where you would actually see someone consuming food. I chose a young, attractive female that is smiling and looking at the camera. I know you have to beware of someone smiling at the picture, but since she is eating food and it looks professional I believe it to be okay. If it was just a stick photo of a person doing nothing, I would not use it. She appears to be happy with the catering. Also, the food is colorful but out of focus, enticing the viewer to guess what exotic dish she could be eating. The uniquely shaped plate suggests the catering company is trendy and modern. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
  							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 2.	I resized the image to 500 x 333 in order to match the other three body images</h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 3.	I got the image from a website called liftingrevolution.com. The picture was meant to make people feel good about what they eat</h1> </a> <font size="6">

							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 1.	I chose this picture to convey the professionalism and skill of the catering company. First, you see the waiter is wearing a nice vest with a white, button-down shirt and dress pants. Second, you see him balancing two plates on his left forearm. This is a sign that the caterer has undergone training and is confident in advanced serving maneuvers of that kind. These two combine to give a feeling of trust in the company that they will deliver a professional experience. The white color of the plates also contrasts with the darkness of his outfits to make the plates pop out of the picture. Also, the food looks delicious and there is a variety. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 2.	I resized the image to 500 x 333 in order to match the other three body images</h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 3.	I got this from a catering company at inglenookcatering.com. It was meant to do pretty much what I would use it for. It conveys an air of professionalism. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 1.	I chose this picture to show that the catering company can accommodate a massive amount of people. In this image alone you can see 60 plates at least. However, every one still looks meticulously prepared and beautiful. This will appeal to corporations and other large organizations that are looking to host a banquet. In addition, the picture just feels crisp. The front plates are extremely in focus and the food looks delicious. Then the out of focus background adds to the gravity of how many plates there are. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 2.	I again resized the image to 500 x 333 in order to match the size of the other 3 body images.</h1> </a> <font size="6">
							<font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 3.	I obtained the image from another catering company at culinariafoodandwine.com. They use it as a large background image on the main page to show the large scale of catering they provide. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

  <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : yellow"> Reference the slide listing links to exercises on guidelines for choosing images. After viewing these web pages select and choose your top five reasons for selecting images and choose an image to illustrate your point.</h1> </a> <font size="6">

  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 1. Relevance, the photo must be relevant to your purpose. Using an image not related to your website will confuse the reader and take away from the content. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 2. Mood, the image must convey a feeling of positivity, trust, and reliability in order to entice the consumer. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 3. Size, the size must be not be too large or too small. Also, multiple images should be the same size unless done for stylistic reasons. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 4. Real People, if the person looks fake and like they were paid to have their picture taken you will lose the trust of the viewer. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> 5. Red Eye, if a human looks like a demon. The viewer will be turned off. You must eliminate red-eye from pictures where a person is staring at the camera. </h1> </a> <font size="6">

   				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> This image is stellar. High quality, conveys a powerful mood, uses real people, is not too big or small, and there is no red eye on the children. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
