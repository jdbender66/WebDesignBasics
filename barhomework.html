	  				            <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White"> You've been hired by a local bar to create a website for them. The owner has provided you two images and wants you to use only one of them. For your site, you need an image that is 800 pixels wide, but the height is up to you. Take one of the two images below and resize and / or crop it to the specifications. Save and upload the edited image along with a short explanation (one or two sentences is fine) of why you chose one image over the other. Try and make it look good. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
			<img src="beer.jpg" alt="This is a beer" />
	  		  <font size="1"> <h1 style="color : White">Out of the two images, this is the more suitable for our cause. Whereas a club would want to advertise complicated drinks like Martinis, a cold beer is more relatable to a bar crowd. The frosted glasses and amber color make it extremely appealing. Another reason it is superior to the other is because you can see the bar in the background. The martini picture blurs out the background and gives you no information on the bar. In the background of the beer picture you can see a modern, trendy establishment with multiple people there. There is a cool brick bar, stylized industrial duct work, and shimmering wood grain tables. </h1> </a> <font size="6">
