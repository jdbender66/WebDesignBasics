<p class="title"> Typography Essay</p>
<p class="para">Typography is an extremely important factor when it comes to webpage design. If you put a lot of thought and effort into font selection, your webpage can look
 clean and professional. However, if font type is neglected it can disrupt the whole style of a webpage and make it displeasing to look at. 
 You can single-handedly aid with the organization of a website by selecting appropriate typography. By making headings larger and bolder, 
 you can differentiate between sections of information. Color coordinating can also stylistically improve the design of a webpage. 
 The impression given to a viewer is also based on font type. A cursive font conveys classiness, while a playful font like Jokerman or Comic Sans expresses
 a less serious tone. There are many properties that go into selecting a suitable font. First, there are two types of font collections. Serif has small strokes
 at the end of the character strokes. Times New Roman is a serif font that is commonly used for text. Sans-serif does not have the extra small strokes, 
 and looks simpler. The new Microsoft Word defaults to Calibri, a common Sans-serif font. Sans-Serif is becoming more prevalent on the web to help webpages 
 look simplistic and uncluttered. Choosing a Serif or Sans-Serif font can drastically change the feel of some text. On top of the two types of font collections, 
 there is even more customization that can be done. Text-indent, text-decoration, text-alignment, text-transformation, letter-spacing, word-spacing, 
 line-height, and vertical-alignment are all properties of text that tweak the appearance based on your specific needs. </p>
 
 
	<p class="para">Choosing text also differs based on the medium of delivery. Physical text in a book or on a sheet of paper has a little more leniency.
	You can adjust the distance from your eyes, and typically get closer to read cluttered, Serif text. However, when viewing text on a screen you don’t 
	want to have to lean in and squint to read something. That is why text on the web is typically larger, spaced out, and simpler. Another difference is 
	that there is less selection for html fonts. There are only a handful of fonts available to use when stylizing using CSS. You must access fonts that
	already exist within the framework of the programming language. This makes it sometimes difficult to combine multiple fonts and have them complement 
	each other.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	
<p class="headin">1.	Match your design</p>
<br>The typography must match the style of the website. Don’t use whimsical fonts if the website has a serious message. On the contrary, don’t use serious typefaces if the webpage is trying to convey a friendly, jovial feeling. You cannot forget the context of the webpage. In addition, if the background is complex you want the text to be simple. For a successful website, everything much match and be cohesive.
 <br><br><p class="headin">2.	Layout</p>
<br>It doesn’t matter how beautiful your text is, if it is laid out messily the whole webpage will look awful. To maximize readability and scalability for your reader, premeditate how the text will be organized. You can choose a grid to provide a clear balance and geometric structure to your site. It establishes a visual hierarchy that guides the reader’s eyes through the content.
 <br><br><p class="headin">3.	Font</p>
<br>This is obviously a huge part of typography as it is what the text actually looks like. You should choose an eye-catching, unique typeface that isn’t used very much. It should convey a feeling to the viewer. This feeling should also be relevant to what your web page is about. You want it to exude classiness and convey the thought to the user, “This webpage knows what it’s doing”.
 <br><br><p class="headin">4.	Size</p>
<br>The size of the font is another extremely important factor in designing a website. The larger the text, the more the user’s eye will be drawn to it. A larger font size indicates a higher priority and it is commonly applied to headings. This allows the reader to find the information relevant to them easily. Conversely, a smaller font size de-emphasizes content and signifies the body of the webpage.
 <br><br><p class="headin">5.	Color</p>
<br>Color and color contrast can drastically change the attitude of text. It is a great way to distinguish between navigation, headings, links, and body text. Greyed out text signifies an inactive link or button. Blue text represents a link to another webpage. Red text indicates a warning message. Lighter colored text is usually less important than text with a darker tone. There are many different ways to utilize color to alter the way typography affects a webpage.
 <br><br><p class="headin">6.	Cases</p>
<br>Uppercase and lowercase text can also be used to change the feel of a website. Headings can be entirely capitalized to add emphasis. If the same font is used throughout, capitalization can help distinguish between different sections of text. However, you want to avoid using all uppercase in the body paragraph of text.
 <br><br><p class="headin">7.	Style and Decoration</p>
<br>Users, especially ones familiar with Microsoft word, tend to overuse stylistic effects on text. Underlining and italics are useful, but can be used wrongly. You shouldn’t underline anything that isn’t a link, it can confuse a user. Use italics instead to emphasize certain words.
 <br><br><p class="headin">8.	Hierarchy</p>
<br>Using a hierarchy of typography as you progress down a webpage can really help to make content flow to user. It is all relative, and doesn’t just have to be done with font size. The headings and titles at the top should be generally larger, and maybe a different color, weight, or placement. Subheadings should also be larger than the body text, but less accented than the main page heading.
 <br><br><p class="headin">9.	Space</p>
<br>Spacing can greatly influence other factors of good typography such as the layout or hierarchy of a webpage. There are various ways to create space such as a block break, paragraph break, tracking, leading, indentations, and margins. A lack of text is just as important as the text itself. To achieve a pleasing organization, blank space must be used effectively.
 <br><br><p class="headin">10.	Be Unorthodox</p>
<br>In a competitive website design industry, being edgy and thinking out of the box can be very effective in creating a stimulating webpage. Users want to be surprised when they load a page. Using an intriguing typeface or a unique combination of text effects can singlehandedly grab a reader’s attention. Consider this when designing, and realize that sticking to the rules is not always the way to go.
